Here are some ideas for the Naruvi Hospitals website:

Improve the design of the website. The current website is quite outdated and could use a fresh new look. A modern design would make the website more user-friendly and appealing to visitors.
Add more information about the hospital's services. 

The current website does not provide much information about the hospital's services. Visitors should be able to easily find information about the different departments and services offered by the hospital.

Make it easier to book appointments. The current process for booking appointments is quite complicated. It would be helpful to have a more streamlined process that makes it easier for patients to book appointments online.

Add a blog section. A blog section would be a great way to share information about the hospital's services, upcoming events, and patient stories. This would help to build trust and credibility with potential patients.

Improve the search functionality. The current search functionality is not very effective. It would be helpful to have a more powerful search engine that allows patients to find the information they are looking for quickly and easily.

Add a testimonials section. A testimonials section would be a great way to showcase positive reviews from patients. This would help to build trust and credibility with potential patients.

Make the website mobile-friendly. The current website is not mobile-friendly. This means that it is difficult to use on a mobile device. It is important to make the website mobile-friendly so that patients can access it from their smartphones and tablets.

By implementing these ideas, Naruvi Hospitals can improve their website and make it more user-friendly and informative. This will help to attract new patients and improve the overall patient experience.
